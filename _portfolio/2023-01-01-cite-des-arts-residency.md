      This residency at Cité des arts in Saint-Denis, Réunion, was instrumental in developing the **Racines & Résonances** performance. The time spent on the island allowed for deep exploration of biosonification techniques, plant bio-signals, and the creation of an immersive audiovisual concert that merges modular synthesis with generative visuals.

      The residency provided access to resources and a creative environment that enabled experimentation with biological data capture systems, transforming plant signals into sound textures and contemporary visual projections. This work exists at the intersection of experimental music, free jazz, electronic music, sound design, and field recording.
