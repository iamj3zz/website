    title: "About the Project"
    content: |
      *Exercitation Ullamco* is a **large-scale outdoor sound installation** commissioned by the Amsterdam Light Festival. The work uses environmental sensors to capture urban data—temperature, wind speed, humidity, movement—and transforms this information into constantly evolving musical compositions that respond to the city's rhythms.

      Spanning two key locations in Amsterdam's waterfront area, the installation creates an immersive sonic environment that reflects and amplifies the character of its surroundings. Custom algorithms process the sensor data in real-time, generating melodic and rhythmic patterns that shift throughout the day and night.

      The project represents a unique collaboration between sound art, interaction design, and architecture, creating a public artwork that makes the invisible flows of urban data audible and emotionally resonant.
