  Educational workshops and ateliers exploring plant biosonification through the collective "Nout plant i chant". Participants learn to capture plant vibrations and transform them into melodies using sensor technology.
description: |
  Biosonification Workshops are educational ateliers facilitated by J3ZZ and the collective "Nout plant i chant" that teach participants how plants can "sing" by using sensors to capture their vibrations and convert them into melodies. These immersive, participatory experiences aim to reconnect people with the plant world while raising awareness about botanical diversity, particularly Réunion's endemic flora.

  The workshops combine science, art, and ecology through hands-on experimentation with the vibrotanica device technology. Held across multiple locations in Réunion and other regions, these ateliers serve students, educators, and general audiences in natural and cultural settings.
