    title: "About the Performance"
    content: |
      *Reprehenderit* is a **theatrical live performance** integrating spoken word, electroacoustic textures, and spatially-distributed sound sources throughout the venue. Currently in development for a premiere at Kaaitheater in Brussels, the work explores the intersection of voice, technology, and theatrical space.

      The performance features collaboration with Polish spoken word artist Maria Kowalska, whose texts will be processed through live electronics and distributed across multiple speakers positioned throughout the venue. The spatial distribution of sound creates a theatrical environment where audience members in different locations hear different perspectives of the same performance.

      **Note: This work is currently in development with a planned premiere in June 2025. Details may change during the development process.**
