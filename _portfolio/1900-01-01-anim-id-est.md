    title: "About the Performance"
    content: |
      *Anim Id Est* is an **immersive live performance in complete darkness**, where spatial audio techniques guide the audience through a sonic journey. The work removes all visual stimuli, forcing listeners to engage purely with sound and their own imagination.

      Performed in complete darkness with the audience seated in a circle surrounded by a 32-channel speaker array, the work uses advanced spatial audio techniques to create the sensation of sounds moving through three-dimensional space. Tones appear to orbit the audience, dive from above, emerge from below, and move in complex geometric patterns that would be impossible in normal stereo listening.

      The absence of light heightens other senses, with many audience members reporting that they could "see" the sounds as they moved through space. The performance creates a meditative, almost trance-like state where time becomes elastic and the boundary between self and sound begins to dissolve. Some participants describe the experience as transformative, comparable to deep meditation or sensory deprivation therapy.
