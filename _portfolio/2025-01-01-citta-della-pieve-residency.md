      This residency in Citta Della Pieve, Italy, was dedicated to developing the **Vibrotanica** immersive interactive audiovisual installation. The historic setting and rich artistic traditions of this Italian town provided an ideal environment for creating this innovative work.

      The residency enabled the development and refinement of the "Vibrotanica box" — a custom bioelectrical sensor system designed by the artist to capture micro-electrical variations in plants. This technology transforms plant bio-signals into real-time sounds and visuals, creating an immersive experience that explores the symbiotic relationship between humans and nature.

      The work combines ambisonic audio, HD projection, generative visuals, and complex software interfaces to create an atmosphere where each interaction between visitors and plants triggers a unique audiovisual response.
