description: |
  A short film exploring themes of art, colors, sex, love, and communication. The filmmaker drew inspiration from Paul Klee's philosophy: "Art does not reproduce the visible; rather, it makes visible." The composer crafted the score using cello and violin harmonies and dissonances as metaphors for the relationship dynamics between the two main characters.
