  MASSOLIT SERIES documents a cycle of seven improvisation concerts held at Massolit Books & Café, Budapest in 2015. Founded and hosted by J3ZZ, the concept was simple: two artists meet with no preparation and improvise, interact on the spot for approximately 30 minutes, followed by an audience Q&A session.

  Each session brought together J3ZZ on violin and electronics with a different invited musician from Budapest's contemporary, experimental, and jazz scenes: Ernő Zoltán Rubik (Series 02), Áron Porteleki (Series 01 and 03), Endre Kertész (Series 04), Bálint Bolcsó (Series 05), and Zsolt Sőrés / Ahad (Series 06). Series 07 was a solo performance.

  The complete live recordings were released as a digital album on September 10, 2015, on Bandcamp.
