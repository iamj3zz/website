    content: |
      *Aliquip Ex Ea* is an **experimental live performance** exploring the boundaries of feedback and noise, pushing audio equipment to its physical limits. Performed at Unsound Festival in Krakow, this work investigates the musicality hidden within chaos and distortion.

      Using a no-input mixing board, contact microphones, and an array of distortion pedals, J3ZZ creates a 45-minute journey through extreme sonic territories. The no-input technique involves routing the mixer's output back into its inputs, creating complex feedback loops that can be manipulated and sculpted in real-time. Every movement becomes amplified, every touch generates cascading harmonics.

      The performance is as much about physical endurance as it is about sonic exploration, with the artist coaxing musical patterns from seemingly uncontrollable noise. The result is an intense, visceral experience that challenges conventional notions of musicality and beauty.
