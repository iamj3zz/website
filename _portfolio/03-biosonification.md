    title: "About the EP"
    content: |
      *Consectetur* is an experimental EP that explores the **intersection of ambient textures and rhythmic structures**. Recorded entirely using field recordings captured in the dramatic Icelandic landscape and processed through analog synthesis techniques.

      The project emerged from a month-long residency in Reykjavik, where the extreme environment and unique soundscapes of Iceland provided both inspiration and source material. Each track was carefully crafted to preserve the organic character of the field recordings while transforming them through tape manipulation and granular processing.

      This release represents a departure from purely electronic composition, embracing the unpredictable nature of environmental sound and the warmth of analog equipment.
