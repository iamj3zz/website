description: |
  Suprema is a dance and theater production that explores the Wonder Woman character through a distinctly female perspective. The work examines a grotesque world where reality slips into fantasy, investigating themes of female power, personality layers, desire, sexuality, and fear through two performers. J3ZZ composed and produced the music for this production created by the Imre Zoltán Program. The production premiered on September 6, 2020 at Latinovits-Bujtor Játékszín in Veszprém, with age recommendation of 16 years and older.
