    title: "About the Collaboration"
    content: |
      *Duis Aute Irure* is a **collaborative split release** with electronic producer Alex Kim, juxtaposing digital glitch aesthetics with warm analog tape textures. The split format allows each artist to present their distinct approach while creating a cohesive listening experience.

      Side A, by J3ZZ, explores digital glitch aesthetics through fragmented rhythms, bit-crushed textures, and algorithmic composition. The tracks embrace the beauty of digital artifacts and errors, transforming technical imperfections into musical elements. Side B, by Alex Kim, counters this with warm analog tape processing, creating lush ambient soundscapes that emphasize organic decay and subtle harmonic shifts.

      Despite their different approaches, both sides share a common interest in texture, atmosphere, and the spaces between sounds. The collaboration emerged from late-night studio sessions in Toronto, where the two artists discovered their complementary aesthetics could create something greater than either could achieve alone.
