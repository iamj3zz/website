  A contemporary dance piece exploring adolescence through the lives of four teenagers. The work presents their daily experiences, aspirations, and desires within a surreal, greenhouse-like setting where themes of fate and life's meaning unfold with "black humour and self-irony." The narrative arc progresses from hopeful youth to the realization of life's complexities.
