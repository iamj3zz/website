    title: "About the Performance"
    content: |
      *Quis Nostrud* is a **high-energy performance** combining hardware synthesizers and live percussion, featuring improvisation and dynamic audio processing. Performed at Sónar Festival in Barcelona, the work creates an intense sonic experience that bridges electronic music and live instrumentation.

      J3ZZ performs on a setup of hardware synthesizers including Moog and Elektron machines, while percussionist Carla Rius provides live acoustic rhythms that are processed in real-time through effects chains and looping systems. The interaction between the two performers creates a dynamic, ever-evolving soundscape where electronic and acoustic elements blur together.

      The performance is structured around improvisation, with both musicians responding to each other's energy and ideas in the moment. This creates a unique experience for each show, with no two performances being exactly alike. The high-energy approach and driving rhythms have made this collaboration a favorite at electronic music festivals across Europe.
