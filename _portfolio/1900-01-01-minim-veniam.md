    text_content: |
      *Minim Veniam* is a **minimalist release** focusing on micro-sound and silence, exploring the subtle textures found in barely audible sonic phenomena. The work challenges listeners to engage with sound at the threshold of perception.

      Recorded using high-resolution field recording equipment in the quiet landscapes of rural Norway, the album captures sounds that are normally imperceptible: the hum of electrical equipment, the movement of air, the settling of materials, the distant resonances of natural processes. These sounds are then carefully processed and arranged to create contemplative sonic environments.

      The release embraces silence as an active compositional element, with long pauses that allow the listener's environment to become part of the listening experience. This approach draws inspiration from the minimalist traditions of composers like Alvin Lucier and Eliane Radigue while incorporating contemporary digital processing techniques.
