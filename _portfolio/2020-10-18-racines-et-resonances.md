description: |
  Racines & Résonances is an immersive artistic project by J3ZZ that explores the intersection of botany, sound art, and music. Using specialized sensors, the project captures plant vibrations and transforms them into melodies and soundscapes, creating a multisensory experience that celebrates the "voice" of nature.

  The project includes both participatory workshops (Biosonification workshop) and concert performances, performed across multiple countries including Hungary, Réunion, and Mauritius. The work combines scientific curiosity about plant communication with artistic improvisation, inviting audiences to listen to the "plant language" (musique végétale) in new ways.

  Key performances and workshops have taken place at prestigious venues including Francia Intézet Budapest, Institut français de Maurice, Jardin de l'État (Saint-Denis), and at the Brain Bar Festival.
