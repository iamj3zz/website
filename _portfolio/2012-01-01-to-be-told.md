  To be told is a documentary film directed by Lorenzo Ciacciavicca, born from a Grundtvig Workshop residency held in Florence (16–24 March 2012). The project brought together twenty citizens from minority groups across the European Union to share narratives and creative expressions — stories and cultural assets at risk of disappearing — translating them into drama, dance, photo, video, and written form.

  J3ZZ participated as an artist in the residency itself, and took on the full audio responsibilities for the documentary: composer, performer, producer, sound designer, and sound editor.

  Conceived and coordinated by Pietro Gaglianò, the project was managed by Marina Bistolfi at Associazione Fabbrica Europa and supported by the EU Lifelong Learning Programme (Grundtvig).

J3ZZ was one of the twenty participants.

      Beyond his role as a residency artist, J3ZZ handled the entire audio dimension of the resulting documentary: composition, performance, production, sound design, and sound editing.
