  The project represents "an exercise in observation and analysis of the plurality that characterizes the European Union." It examined relationships between dominant and minority cultures within the EU, exploring how cultural exchange and permeability enable transformation. A Grundtvig Workshop brought together twenty citizens from minority groups across the EU to share narratives and creative expressions addressing cultural assets at risk of disappearance.
