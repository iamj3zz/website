  IRIS is a lumino-kinetic sound installation created by Zalán Adorján, András Nagy, and J3ZZ. Laser beams illuminate a mirrored sphere moving vertically through an artificial fog atmosphere, producing a chromatic dispersion effect that evokes the iris of the eye and the rainbow-paving goddess of Greek mythology. The piece — one of the few installations with a definite beginning and end — premiered at the Lighthouse Art 2020 exhibition at the Csokonai Theatre in Debrecen, Hungary.

      Within the prestigious Csokonai Theatre in Debrecen, "IRIS" was unveiled as a captivating lumino-kinetic installation, marking a highlight of the Lighthouse Exhibition from August 18 to 22, 2020. This work, a collaboration between András Nagy, J3ZZ, and Zalán Adorján, stands at the intersection of art and science, offering a deep exploration of geometry, optics, and human memory through the prism of laser light. 
      
      Set in the historically and culturally rich environment of the Csokonai Theatre, "IRIS" invites spectators to reflect on how light and sound can evoke and manipulate memories. The light beams, captured in endless reflections, symbolize recurring thoughts and persistent memories, offering a powerful visual metaphor for the traumatic experiences that mark our psyche.
      
      The exhibition of "IRIS" at the Csokonai Theatre was not only a technical and artistic feat; it also created a space for dialogue and introspection for visitors, encouraging them to contemplate the cyclical nature of memory and the impact of memories on our perception of reality. The innovative use of technology and immersive sound design magnified this experience, transforming the theatrical space into a meeting place between the past, present, and future.
      
      The premiere of "IRIS" at the Lighthouse Exhibition underscored the creators' commitment to exploring new forms of artistic expression, even in challenging times. By choosing the Csokonai Theatre as the setting for this installation, András Nagy, J3ZZ, and Zalán Adorján not only paid homage to an iconic site of Hungarian culture but also reaffirmed the role of art as a vehicle for reflection and societal evolution.
      
      "IRIS" remains a testament to the ephemeral beauty of light and its power to evoke and transform our most intimate memories. This installation continues to inspire and provoke, inviting each spectator on a personal journey through the labyrinth of their own memory, guided by light and sound within the majestic setting of the Csokonai Theatre.
