      This residency at Kerveguen in Saint-Pierre, southern Réunion, was a key period in developing the **Racines & Résonances** performance. The focused creative environment allowed for continued exploration and refinement of biosonification techniques and the live audiovisual concert format.

      The residency enabled further experimentation with the symbiotic relationship between plants and humans, developing the biological data capture systems and audiovisual components that would become central to the Racines & Résonances performance.
