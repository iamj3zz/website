    title: "About the Performance"
    content: |
      *Fugiat Nulla* is a **club-oriented live set** blending techno rhythms with experimental sound design, featuring custom-built hardware controllers. Performed as part of WORM's New Year's Eve celebration, this work bridges the gap between underground club music and experimental electronic art.

      The performance uses custom MIDI controllers designed and built by J3ZZ in collaboration with hardware designer Maarten Vos. These controllers allow for tactile, expressive manipulation of sound parameters that would be impossible with standard DJ equipment. The setup includes modular synthesizers, effects processors, and Ableton Live, all seamlessly integrated to create a hybrid DJ/live performance format.

      The set balances driving techno rhythms with moments of experimental sound design, creating a dynamic journey that keeps the energy high while introducing unexpected sonic elements. This approach has made the performance popular in both club contexts and experimental music festivals across Europe.
