    title: "About the Installation"
    content: |
      *Culpa Qui Officia* is a **biofeedback installation** using heart rate and breathing patterns to generate unique sonic compositions for each visitor. The work explores the intimate connection between physiological states and musical experience, creating personalized soundscapes that reflect each individual's internal rhythms.

      Visitors wear sensors that monitor their heart rate and breathing patterns in real-time. This biometric data is fed into a generative audio system that creates musical compositions directly influenced by these physiological signals. Fast heartbeats produce more energetic rhythms, while slow, deep breathing generates calm, sustained tones. Each person's unique physiological signature creates a one-of-a-kind composition that could never be reproduced.

      The installation includes a feedback loop where the generated music can influence the visitor's physiological state, which in turn affects the music, creating a dynamic system of mutual influence. This creates a meditative experience where visitors become both composer and instrument.
