    title: "About the Installation"
    content: |
      *Pariatur Excepteur* is an **outdoor sound sculpture** responding to weather conditions, translating wind speed, temperature, and humidity into evolving sonic patterns. The work creates a living dialogue between environmental data and musical composition, making the invisible forces of weather audible.

      The sculpture uses an array of weather sensors to continuously monitor atmospheric conditions, feeding this data into generative algorithms that create musical responses. High winds produce energetic, turbulent sounds, while calm conditions generate gentle, meditative tones. Temperature shifts modulate harmonics, and humidity affects the density of the sonic texture.

      Installed in Helsinki Sculpture Park for six months, the work evolved with the changing seasons, capturing the transition from spring to autumn. The solar-powered system ensured continuous operation without environmental impact, allowing the sculpture to become a permanent voice of the park's microclimate.
