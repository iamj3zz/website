    text_content: |
      *Cillum Dolore* is a **dark ambient release** inspired by arctic landscapes, featuring processed hydrophone recordings and subterranean drones. The album explores the hidden sonic world beneath arctic ice, where the sounds of water, ice movement, and marine life create an otherworldly soundscape.

      Recorded during a residency in Tromsø, Norway, within the Arctic Circle, the album uses specialized hydrophone equipment to capture underwater sounds from fjords and coastal areas. These recordings reveal a sonic environment that is simultaneously alien and deeply primal—the creaking of ice, the distant calls of whales, the movement of water through underwater caverns.

      The field recordings are processed through convolution and layered with deep sub-bass drones to create compositions that evoke the vast, dark depths of arctic waters. The result is an album that is both meditative and unsettling, beautiful and harsh—much like the arctic environment that inspired it.
