  The composer was commissioned to create music for choreographer Tímea Sebestyén's contemporary dance work. The soundtrack comprises several compositions including a series titled "Tape," referencing machinery invented by Dr. William Moulton Marston, creator of Wonder Woman. The composer incorporated "sound references to the different mechanical parts" and piano hammer sounds representing the character's voice. Additional tracks included "Nutter," addressing "a lost mind leaning towards schizophrenia," and a remixed version of "False Truths" for the performance climax. The performance examines Wonder Woman as "a female ideal created by dr. William Moulton Marston," exploring her character through a female perspective. It investigates "layers of our personality through our desires, sexuality, and fears," questioning concepts of female power and identity.
