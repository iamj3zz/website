description: |
  A special space, sound, and dance installation allowing audiences to move freely and choose their viewing perspective. The production reimagines the 1841 romantic ballet "Giselle" through contemporary choreography, exploring "a complex picture of a love triangle and the power of jealousy" while discovering modern interpretations of classical characters and themes.
