description: |
  "ebb flow + debris (6 humans)" was a live interdisciplinary performance exploring the interconnections and departures between sound and movement. Six performers — three musicians and three dancers — built a free improvisation together, moving between group, duet, and solo situations in space, movement, quality, and time.

  Sound: J3ZZ (violin), David Sutherland / Monofog (DIY instruments), Ilauszky Tamás / Monofog (prepared bass).
  Dance: Ferencz Krisztina, Gál Eszter, Nagy Zoltán (dancers, dance teachers, choreographers).

  Monofog is an audio-visual formation by visual artists David Sutherland and Ilauszky Tamás, whose performances blend free improvisation noise and free jazz played on prepared and homemade (DIY) instruments, with strong performance character — on riverbanks, in concert halls, or exhibition spaces.
