description: |
  Creative Jam w/ Grécso Zoltán was a commissioned performance at the Hungarian Dance Academy, organized by choreographer and teacher Zoltán Grécso. The event explored sound and movement collaboration through two parts: first, the artist created live soundscapes for a dance class, then an open jam session where dancers and the sound artist inspired each other in real-time. The artist describes the experience: "I am grateful to have been invited to the dance academy to be myself, accept my mood, experiment soundscapes and push boundaries." A live recording archive of the session was made available on SoundCloud.
