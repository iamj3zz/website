  A live collaboration between Miss God — Polish singer, composer and producer known for subtle electronic sound, deep basslines, and ethnically inspired experimental vocals — and J3ZZ on violin, performed at Szimpla Kert, Budapest on October 15, 2015.

  Miss God's music draws comparisons to Burial, Mister Lies and Soap&Skin. She supported Dizzie Rascal & Modeselektor at Electronic Beats Festival in Poznań (2013), appeared at Ambition Festival (London), Heineken Opener Festival and Soundrive Festival, and won the Skoda & T-Mobile competition for emerging musicians (2014). She also composes for film and performed in Paris with dance theatre Le Flux.
