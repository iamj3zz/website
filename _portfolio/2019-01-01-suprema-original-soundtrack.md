  SUPREMA (Original Soundtrack) is an album by J3ZZ created as the musical score for Tímea Sebestyén's dance performance SUPREMA at MU Theatre in Budapest. The soundtrack combines experimental electronic composition with acoustic violin performance, creating an immersive sonic environment that supports and enhances the choreographic narrative. The music explores themes of transformation, identity, and the interplay between organic and synthetic sound.
