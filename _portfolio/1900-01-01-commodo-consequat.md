    title: "About the Installation"
    content: |
      *Commodo Consequat* is a **participatory sound installation** where audience members collectively shape the sonic output through networked mobile devices and sensors. The work explores collective creativity and the emergence of complex patterns from simple individual actions.

      Visitors download a custom mobile app that allows them to contribute sounds, rhythms, and parameters to the installation's audio engine. The system analyzes all inputs in real-time and synthesizes them into a cohesive sonic environment that responds to the collective will of everyone present. No single person controls the sound—instead, it emerges from the interactions between all participants.

      The installation uses a 16-channel speaker array to create an immersive spatial audio experience that evolves continuously throughout the day. As the museum's visitor patterns change—busy afternoons, quiet mornings—the installation's character shifts accordingly, creating a living sonic portrait of the museum itself.
