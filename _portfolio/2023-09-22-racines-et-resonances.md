      # Basic Concept
      
      The central concept is to explore and stage the symbiotic relationship between plants and humans through an immersive audiovisual show. It highlights **a new dynamic, where improvisation and audience interaction are at the heart of the experience**, offering a fresh perspective on the deep connection between the plant and human worlds.
      
      # Show format
      
      A **60-minute** immersive concert that **includes presentation and interaction with the audience**. This show is led by musician and visual artist J3ZZ, who **performs solo**. On stage, he uses an acoustic **violin, synthesizers**, and various **electronic** instruments. The plants, which play a central role, are connected to **a biological data capture system designed by the artist**. This data is then translated into sound textures and contemporary visual projections. The performance exists at the intersection of **experimental music, free jazz, electronic music, sound design, and field recording**.
      
      # Audiovisual Components
      
      The visual and sound elements are carefully integrated to create a truly **immersive experience**. The sound system, which can be configured in **stereo, quadraphonic, or octophonic depending on the venue's capabilities, places the audience at the center of the acoustic experience**. Ambisonic sound diffusion envelops the spectators, while **large-scale video projections on stage** enhance the immersion. **Concert-style lighting** adds an extra dimension to the visual setup. The interaction between the plants and the artist generates both visuals and music **in real time, merging the natural and human worlds into a unique performance**.
      
      # Themes and Messages
      
      The goal is to enable an enlightened **awareness** and a heightened **consciousness** of our place within the natural universe. The show highlights the **universality** of the connection between all forms of life, while inviting an **inner transformation**, subtly altering the audience's perception to better understand the **impact of our actions on the environment**. Through this geopoetic, collective, and educational experience, this show aspires to strengthen this fragile yet powerful bond with nature, creating a moment of **reflection, wonder, and transformation**.
      
      In addition to raising awareness about **biodiversity preservation**, the show offers a fusion of science, art, and nature, transforming the bio-signals of plants into audiovisual stimuli. This allows spectators to experience an immersive journey where they can **interact directly with the plants, fostering a rich and inclusive social experience**.
      
      # Target Audience

      **Racines & Résonances** is designed to appeal to a broad range of participants, making the experience **accessible** and **engaging** for a diverse audience. The project pays special attention to underserved audiences, thanks to the strong **sensory** dimension of the installation, which engages **touch, sight, and hearing**. This sensory aspect allows the **inclusion** of individuals with **specific needs**, offering them a unique immersive experience.

      Moreover, the show is crafted for an **intergenerational** audience, with a focus on connection and the **sharing of memories, stories, and transgenerational experiences**. It creates a space where all generations can come together, interact, and share a common experience, strengthening family and social bonds through the exploration of nature.
      
      # Staging and Scenography
      
      The staging of **Racines & Résonances** is carefully designed to reinforce the **connection between the ordinary and the extraordinary**. The solemn lighting, focused on the plants, the artist, and his instruments, creates an **intimate and familiar** atmosphere. This evokes the initial mental image of a violinist and potted plants, **grounding** the performance in something recognizable for the audience.
      
      Simultaneously, a **large-scale visual projection** immerses the audience in the reactions of the plants and their interactions with their immediate environment, including the artist and the audience. These visuals, layered within the spectator's field of vision, allow for **deep immersion** in the symbiotic relationship developing on stage.
      
      The fog, generated by machines, evokes the **humidity of tropical forests**, adding an additional sensory dimension to the experience. The biological data capture system, designed by the artist, is highlighted, emphasizing the technological link that deserves daily awareness. Finally, the sound diffusion system is intentionally kept "invisible" so that the **focus remains on the interaction between the artist, the plants, and the visual elements**.
      
      # Collaborations and Contributions
      
      It is primarily a **solo** project, conceived and realized by the artist J3ZZ. To date, the project has not yet incorporated external artistic collaborations, though it remains open to future opportunities in this regard. On the technical side, the team currently consists of a **sound engineer (Front of House)**. As the project evolves, the team will be expanded to include a **video engineer and a lighting engineer**.
      
      # Objectives and Impact

      The ultimate goal goes beyond merely offering an immersive and spectacular experience of **high artistic and technical quality**. The show aims to have a profound **impact on the ecological and artistic consciousness** of the audience. By exploring the relationship between humans, living beings, and technology, it seeks to **transform how individuals relate to the natural world** while encouraging **reflection on the use of technology in daily life.** The performance aspires to foster a deeper, more respectful **awareness of the living world**, as well as critical reflection on **how technology is integrated** into our interactions with the environment.
