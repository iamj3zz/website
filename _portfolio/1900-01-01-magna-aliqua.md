  - type: text
    title: "About the Installation"
    content: |
      *Magna Aliqua* is a **site-specific sound installation** that investigates the acoustic properties of architectural spaces through resonant frequencies and controlled feedback systems. The work transforms the exhibition hall into a living instrument that responds to its own spatial characteristics.

      Using a network of acoustic sensors and a multi-channel sound system, the installation continuously analyzes the room's resonant frequencies and generates tones that interact with the architecture. The feedback between sound output and environmental response creates an ever-evolving sonic landscape that is unique to this specific location.

      The project was developed in close collaboration with architect Marie Dubois and acoustic engineer Thomas Bernard, combining artistic vision with scientific precision to create an immersive experience that reveals the hidden acoustic character of the Palais de Tokyo.
