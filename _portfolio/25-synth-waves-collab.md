    title: "About the Collaboration"
    content: |
      *Synth Waves Collab* is a **collaborative electronic music project** exploring the intersection of analog synthesis and digital processing. Created in partnership with renowned sound designer Alex Rivers, the album represents a meeting point between two distinct approaches to electronic music production.

      J3ZZ's background in algorithmic composition and Max/MSP programming meets Alex Rivers' expertise in analog modular synthesis, creating a unique sonic palette that bridges the gap between computer-based and hardware-based music creation. The project was developed over six months of intensive studio sessions in London, with both artists pushing each other into new creative territories.

      The recording process embraced spontaneity and improvisation, with many tracks emerging from live jam sessions that were then carefully edited and refined. This approach preserved the energy and unpredictability of real-time performance while maintaining the production quality of a studio album.
