  This visual art initiative focuses on animated films targeting children, youth, and adults. The creator served as sound designer and composer, developing audio for three animated shorts and their accompanying documentary and trailer. The project aims to "listen to the inside voice of different cultural communities and spread it through the world." The initiative involves animated films inspired by children's drawings representing daily life in Najaf (Iraq), Istanbul (Turkey), and Nicosia (Cyprus). Workshops in these cities gathered drawings from children aged 6-10, which then informed the animation production. The completed films were screened across Iraq, Turkey, Italy, Spain, and Cyprus.
