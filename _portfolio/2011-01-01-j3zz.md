  J3ZZ is described as "my personal artistic project, a platform for experimentation and dialogue with artists and communities." It functions as "a laboratory" enabling "different productions of art pieces (compositions, recordings and audiovisual installations) and events (talks, performances, improvisation jams, workshops etc.)" The core concept centers on experimental sound creation: "J3ZZ - Experimental sound creations and performances - offers a space where the audience can experience the instant creativity of sound artists. Artists meet with no preparation and improvise!" The Massolit Series specifically provides "a space where the audience can experience the instant creativity of sound artists" with approximately 30-minute improvisation sessions followed by audience Q&A.
