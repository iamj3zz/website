  A Drop in the Ocean is an album by J3ZZ exploring themes of scale, perspective, and the relationship between the individual and the vast. Through experimental electronic music, ambient textures, and processed field recordings, the album creates a sonic meditation on insignificance and interconnectedness, examining how small moments resonate within larger systems.
