description: |
  J3ZZ A/V Performance was a series of audiovisual presentations in September 2019, showcasing new creative work through electronic music and visual composition. The work was presented twice in different intimate settings across Budapest. The first performance took place at egy pici nappali (Association of Hungarian Art Photographers), an exclusive invitation-only event with a házi buli (house party) atmosphere emphasizing environmental consciousness, with attendees bringing reusable cups and their own beverages. The second presentation occurred at the opening party of La Lasagneria Budapest, a larger audiovisual celebration featuring live electronics alongside a photo exhibition and DJ set. Both presentations explored the artist's approach to real-time audiovisual composition, blending sound and image in immersive environments.
