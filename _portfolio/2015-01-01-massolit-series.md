  MASSOLIT SERIES was a concert series founded by J3ZZ at Massolit Books & Café, Budapest in 2015. The format: two artists meet with no preparation and improvise together for approximately 30 minutes, followed by an open Q&A with the audience.

  Over seven sessions, J3ZZ performed on violin and electronics alongside Áron Porteleki (Series 01, 03), Ernő Zoltán Rubik (Series 02), Endre Kertész (Series 04), Bálint Bolcsó (Series 05), and Zsolt Sőrés / Ahad (Series 06). Series 07 was a solo performance. All sessions were recorded live and released as a digital album on September 10, 2015.
