      "Unbalanced Forces" is an interactive sound installation that explores our transition from ancient times to a new era, questioning our tendency to view change as a neglected responsibility rather than an active commitment. First presented at the Labor Gallery in Budapest on February 13, 2016, this immersive work invites deep reflection on a contemporary snapshot of Hungarian society, capturing its essence through an interactive spatial audio experience.
      
      Designed as a living laboratory of interactive experimentation, "Unbalanced Forces" allows the public to navigate through a multi-channel soundscape, offering a meditation on the system in which we live. Participants become actors within this installation, controlling the living space of the exhibition with their own sounds and movements. Through this interaction, the installation provides a powerful metaphor for our involvement in the surrounding system, questioning the forms and impacts of our actions.
      
      The space of "Unbalanced Forces" resonates with the echoes of its visitors, posing fundamental questions about our capacity and willingness to intervene in the course of our shared destiny. Should we raise our voices or remain silent? Do we have the power to change the way we coexist? Are we truly the masters of our fate, and would we dare to speak out or let others speak for us? This interactive installation does not merely present a space and a system; it invites each participant to observe, reflect, and react. "Unbalanced Forces" challenges visitors, encouraging them to recognize their own power and responsibility in creating a shared future.
       
      The premiere of "Unbalanced Forces" at the Labor Gallery marked a significant moment in the artistic exploration of societal engagement and individual responsibility. Through sounds, movements, and interaction, this work offers a unique perspective on the challenges and opportunities of our time, reminding us that action and intervention are not only possible but essential for shaping the future of our society.
