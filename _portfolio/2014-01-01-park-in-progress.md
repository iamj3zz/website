  For this project, the artist created an outdoor spatial audio installation featuring 16 speakers following a residency period. During the residency, they "established a catalogue of sounds produced by human body, creating a vocabulary of sounds." The installation functioned as "a place where the imaginary vision of the performer meet Nicosia's reality." A circus performer and her dog participated in the opening performance alongside the artist.
