    title: "About the Album"
    content: |
      *Tempor Incididunt* is a **concept album** blending electroacoustic composition with techno influences, exploring themes of time dilation and cyclical patterns. Currently in production, the album investigates how electronic music can manipulate our perception of time through rhythm, repetition, and gradual transformation.

      The album structure mirrors concepts from physics and philosophy: tracks evolve through cyclical patterns that seem to speed up and slow down, creating a sense of temporal elasticity. Techno-influenced beats provide rhythmic anchors while electroacoustic processing creates atmospheric layers that challenge conventional song structures.

      **Note: This work is currently unpublished and in production. Release date to be announced.**
