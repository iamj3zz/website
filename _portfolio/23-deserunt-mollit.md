    text_title: "About the Double Album"
    text_content: |
      *Deserunt Mollit* is a **double album** of piano-driven electronic compositions, blending classical instrumentation with contemporary production techniques. The work explores the meeting point between acoustic piano performance and digital manipulation, creating a unique sonic palette that honors both traditions.

      Recorded at FAMU Studio in Prague on a Steinway Model D, the piano performances serve as the foundation for electronic processing and layering. The first disc focuses on more minimal, intimate compositions where the piano remains largely acoustic, while the second disc ventures into more experimental territory with heavy processing, granular synthesis, and integration with software synthesizers.

      The album represents two years of composition and production work, exploring how the warmth and expressiveness of acoustic piano can coexist with the precision and possibilities of digital music production. The result is a deeply emotional album that speaks to both classical music listeners and electronic music fans.
