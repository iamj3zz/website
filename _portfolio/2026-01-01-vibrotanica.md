abstract: "An immersive interactive installation using bioelectrical sensors to capture plant bio-signals and transform them into real-time sound and visuals, connecting humans and nature."
description: |
  Vibrotanica is an immersive interactive audiovisual installation exploring the symbiotic relationship between humans and plants. Bioelectrical sensors capture micro-electrical variations in plants and transform them into real-time sounds and visuals — every interaction with a plant triggers a unique audiovisual response. The work raises awareness about biodiversity, fosters empathy towards nature, and invites reflection on our connection to the environment.

      Visitors explore the interactions between humans and plants by transforming the **bio-signals** of plants into **visual and auditory stimuli**.

      The project uses **bioelectrical sensors to capture the micro-electrical variations** in plants through the "Vibrotanica box", a device designed by the artist. These signals are then transformed into data to generate **real-time sounds and visuals**. The installation features an immersive sound system, high-definition video projectors, and a complex software interface that enables the creation of ambisonic visuals and sounds. These technologies work together to create an **immersive atmosphere where each interaction between the visitors and the plants triggers a unique audiovisual response**.

      **Vibrotanica** is an artistic and technological exploration that immerses the audience in the profound and **symbiotic relationship between humans and plants**. This installation not only aims to raise awareness about the importance of the environment and biodiversity but also seeks to evoke strong emotions related to **empathy, the fragility of our ecosystem, and the intimate connection between humans and nature**.

      The goal is to foster enlightened **awareness and mindfulness** of our place within the natural universe. The installation highlights the **universality of the bond between all forms of life** while inviting an **inner transformation**, subtly altering the audience's perception to better understand the impact of our actions on the environment. Through this geopoetic, collective, and educational experience, **Vibrotanica** aspires to strengthen this fragile yet powerful connection with nature, creating a moment of **reflection, wonder, and transformation**.

      The staging of **Vibrotanica** is meticulously designed to **amplify the connection between the ordinary and the extraordinary**. The solemn lighting, focused on the plants, creates an **intimate and familiar atmosphere**, evoking the common imagery of potted plants and grounding the work in something recognizable for the audience. **Large-scale visual projections** immerse the audience in the reactions of the plants and their interactions with their immediate environment. The fog, generated by machines, evokes the **humidity of tropical forests**, adding an additional sensory dimension to the experience. The sound diffusion system is intentionally kept "invisible" so that the **focus remains on the interaction between the artist, the plants, and the visual elements**.

      **Vibrotanica** targets a broad spectrum of participants, making the experience **accessible and engaging for a diverse audience**. The project places special emphasis on including marginalized or underserved groups by leveraging the **strong sensory dimension** of the installation, which **engages touch, sight, and hearing**. The work is also designed for an **intergenerational** audience, creating a space where people of all ages can come together and share a common experience, thereby **strengthening familial and social bonds through the exploration of nature**.
