  EU-funded interdisciplinary performing arts project bringing together young music, media and dance artists from four European countries for improvisation-based performances combining visuals, music and movement.
description: |
  Talking heArts was an EU-funded (Youth in Action) interdisciplinary performing arts initiative running from February to November 2012. As artistic director and violinist, Jérôme Li-Thiao-Té led a pan-European ensemble of 17+ young music, media, and dance artists from Hungary, Italy, Romania, and Spain.

  The project's core challenge was to strongly interconnect visuals with performing activities — bringing together dancers, musicians, and media artists into a shared improvisation language. Each participant or small group developed ways to interact with others: codes and hand signs, sensors with programming, defined spatial zones on stage. The resulting shows combined visuals, music, and movement into one-hour improvisation-based performances.

  The project consisted of three residency phases across Europe, each culminating in a public performance: Florence (Fabbrica Europa Festival, May 2012), Budapest (Sziget Festival A38 stage, August 2012), and Bucharest (Godot Café, October 2012). A pre-show was also organized at Toldi Club, Budapest in July 2012.

  Lead coordinator: Subjective Values Foundation (Budapest). Partners: Associazione culturale Fabbrica Europa (Florence), EuroEst Foundation (Bucharest), University of Barcelona–LMI (Spain).
