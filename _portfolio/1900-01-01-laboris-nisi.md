    text_content: |
      *Laboris Nisi* is a **full-length album** merging industrial soundscapes with melodic drone, exploring the sonic landscape of abandoned factories and machinery in Detroit. The album emerged from extensive field recording sessions in decommissioned industrial sites, capturing the resonance of empty spaces and the ghost-like hum of dormant equipment.

      The recordings were then processed through analog synthesis and tape loops, creating layered compositions that balance harsh industrial noise with surprisingly melodic drones. The result is an album that pays homage to Detroit's industrial heritage while creating something entirely new from its sonic remnants.

      The album was mastered by Rashad Becker at Dubplates & Mastering, whose expertise helped preserve the rawness of the field recordings while giving the overall sound a powerful, immersive quality.
