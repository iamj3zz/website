    text_content: |
      *Occaecat Cupidatat* is a **genre-defying album** that combines elements of jazz, breakbeat, and musique concrète into a cohesive sonic exploration. Created through extensive tape manipulation and creative sampling techniques, the album pushes the boundaries between acoustic and electronic music.

      The recording features live performances by acclaimed Hungarian jazz musicians Márton Fenyvesi (saxophone) and Péter Oláh (double bass), whose improvisations were then deconstructed and reassembled using analog tape machines and Eurorack modular systems. The result is a unique hybrid of organic performance and electronic abstraction.

      Recorded at Jumpcut Studios in Budapest with additional sessions in the artist's home studio, the album represents two years of experimentation and refinement. The mixing process intentionally preserved the warmth of tape saturation while maintaining the clarity needed for the complex rhythmic elements.
