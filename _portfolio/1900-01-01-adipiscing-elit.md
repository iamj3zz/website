  # About the installation
  - type: text
    title: "About the Installation"
    content: |
      *Adipiscing Elit* is an **immersive multichannel sound installation** that examines the relationship between organic and synthetic sounds through algorithmic composition. The work creates a constantly evolving sonic environment where natural field recordings interact with computer-generated tones in unexpected ways.

      Using SuperCollider and custom algorithms, the installation analyzes the acoustic properties of organic sounds (water, wind, animal calls) and generates synthetic counterparts that mirror and respond to these natural elements. The 24-channel sound system creates a three-dimensional audio space that surrounds visitors, allowing them to experience the blurred boundary between nature and technology.

      Developed during a residency at Tokyo University of the Arts, the project represents a philosophical inquiry into the nature of "naturalness" in our technologically mediated world. As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly sophisticated at mimicking organic processes, where do we draw the line between real and synthetic?
