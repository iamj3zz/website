    title: "About the Performance"
    content: |
      *Proident Sunt* is a **durational performance piece** exploring sustained tones and gradual transformations, performed continuously over six hours. The work draws inspiration from the minimalist traditions of La Monte Young and Pauline Oliveros while incorporating contemporary electronic processing.

      The performance begins with a single sustained tone that very gradually evolves through subtle shifts in timbre, harmonics, and spatial placement. Over the course of six hours, this initial sound transforms through barely perceptible changes, creating a meditative experience that challenges conventional notions of musical time and listener attention.

      Audience members are invited to come and go as they please, experiencing different phases of the transformation. Some stay for the entire six hours, reporting profound states of deep listening and altered perception. The work questions the relationship between time, patience, and musical experience in our accelerated contemporary culture.
