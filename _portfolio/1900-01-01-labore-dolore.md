    title: "About the Performance"
    content: |
      *Labore Et Dolore* is an **intense live coding performance** that utilizes algorithmic composition and machine learning to create unpredictable sonic landscapes in real-time. Performed at MUTEK Festival in Montreal, the work pushes the boundaries of what's possible in improvised electronic music.

      Using TidalCycles and SuperCollider, J3ZZ writes code on stage that generates complex rhythmic and melodic patterns. Machine learning models, trained on thousands of hours of experimental music, suggest unexpected variations and transformations that the performer can accept, modify, or reject in real-time. This creates a unique collaboration between human creativity and artificial intelligence.

      The performance is accompanied by reactive visuals by Clara Martinez, whose custom software responds to the audio output, creating a tightly integrated audiovisual experience. The result is a 60-minute journey through constantly evolving soundscapes that could never be reproduced exactly the same way twice.
