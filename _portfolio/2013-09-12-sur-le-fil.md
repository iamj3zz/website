  Solo violin improvisation show — nude and contemporary acoustic violin, performed live without preparation. Two recordings released on Bandcamp.
description: |
  Sur le fil is a solo live act by J3ZZ — free improvisation on acoustic violin, performed alone with no preparation and no electronics. The title ("on the wire") reflects the tightrope quality of real-time solo improvisation.

  The show was performed five times between 2013 and 2017, in Florence, Budapest, and Singapore. Two performances were recorded and released on Bandcamp: the premiere at Frau Frisor, Florence (September 12, 2013, 25:42) and the FKSE Studio Gallery, Budapest (July 2, 2015, 15:09).
