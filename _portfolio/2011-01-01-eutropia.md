  A multidisciplinary European cultural initiative involving young artists from nine countries creating evolving performances across Europe. The project engaged participants in workshops and residencies that reimagined the work at each location. Based on the Tower of Babel legend, EUtropia explored themes of coexistence, communication, and shared expression. The concept evolved through a four-month initial residency in Silkeborg, then traveled to partner countries where local artists contributed new perspectives. The project examined loneliness, human relationships, the need for common language, and examined whether universal truth can be defined. Performances employed visual expression through lighting, painting, engraving, and digital audio narratives combining music with sound composition. The live show was created throughout residencies in Cologne (Germany) and Florence (Italy), resulting in a 9-country European tour.
