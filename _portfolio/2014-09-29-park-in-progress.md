  For this project, the artist created an outdoor spatial audio installation featuring 16 speakers following a residency period. During the residency, J3ZZ "established a catalogue of sounds produced by human body, creating a vocabulary of sounds." The installation functioned as "a place where the imaginary vision of the performer meet Nicosia's reality." A circus performer and her dog participated in the opening performance alongside the artist.

      September 29 - October 5, 2014, Nicosia, Cyprus
      Within the historically rich setting of the UN buffer zone in Nicosia, Cyprus, "Park in Progress" emerged as a celebration of the fusion between bodily movement and the sound universe. In 2014, this unique artistic event saw the collaboration between J3ZZ, an innovative musician residing in Budapest, and Audrey Louwet, a trapeze artist from the Azeïn company, creating an unforgettable circus and musical experience within an immersive multichannel audio installation.

      Conceived after an artistic residency focused on capturing a catalog of sounds produced exclusively by the human body, this installation established a unique sound vocabulary, serving as the backdrop for a performance that defies conventions. The recordings, meticulously assembled to create a captivating soundtrack, formed the foundation for a bold exploration of bodily and sonic expression, where every movement and note played resonated with the intimate and collective spaces of our being.

      Audrey Louwet's performance, accompanied by the mesmerizing music of J3ZZ, transformed the outdoor space of Nicosia into a living theater, where the reality of the city blended with the artists' imagination. This collaboration not only highlighted the fluidity and grace of the trapeze artist but also revealed the evocative power of the sounds generated by our bodies, offering the audience a total immersion into a world where sound art and movement converge.

      "Park in Progress," realized as part of the 11th edition in collaboration with the European Pépinières for Young Artists, embodied the spirit of discovery and innovation. This initiative not only enriched the cultural landscape of Nicosia but also posed pertinent questions about our interaction with the urban environment, the ability of art to transform ordinary spaces into places of creativity and exchange, and the role of the audience in the activation and reception of the artwork.

      Through its multidisciplinary approach and successful collaboration, "Park in Progress" left an indelible mark on the public and the international art scene, proving once again that the union of artistic disciplines can open new horizons of expression and perception.
