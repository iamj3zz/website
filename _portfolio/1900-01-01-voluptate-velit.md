    title: "About the Installation"
    content: |
      *Voluptate Velit* is a **light and sound installation** using laser projections and synthesized tones to create immersive geometric audiovisual patterns. The work explores the synesthetic relationship between visual geometry and sonic frequency, creating a space where light and sound become inseparable.

      Twelve laser projectors create constantly evolving geometric patterns that fill the exhibition space, while a 20-channel spatial audio system generates tones that are mathematically linked to the visual forms. Each geometric shape corresponds to specific frequencies and harmonic relationships, creating a direct mapping between what visitors see and what they hear.

      The installation uses generative algorithms that ensure no two moments are exactly alike, with the system continuously generating new patterns based on mathematical principles of symmetry, recursion, and transformation. The result is a meditative yet dynamic environment that invites extended contemplation.
