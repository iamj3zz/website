description: An advent family morning featuring creative workshops and live electronic-violin concert. Children ages 3+ paint and felt while listening to music, guided by animators Eszter Cseke-Marosi and Kinga Petrilla. The concert showcases János Gerzson (multinstrumentalist flutist/oudist) alongside violinist J3ZZ/J3ZZ, blending violin with electronic soundscapes. The program invites audiences through Reunion island, Hungary, Africa, Arabia and Asia with music described as having no borders.
