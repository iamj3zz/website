description: "Biosonification Workshop — The workshop introduces participants to biosonification through the Nout plant i chant collective, which uses sensors to capture plant vibrations and convert them into melodies. This immersive experience aims to reconnect people with the plant world and highlight Réunion's botanical diversity. The event features three interactive workshops: Zilien Atelier combines theater, music, singing, and herbal knowledge in a warm atmosphere. Participants learn to observe aromatic plants and express sensory experiences through colors and emotions while developing group cohesion and vocal techniques. Robinson Atelier explores graphical transcription connections between botany and music through direct illustrations. Children create botanical portraits using plant-based inks on paper, responding to sounds produced by sonified plants. J3ZZ Atelier introduces instruments for plant listening, including patches, synthesizer, and vibrotanica box. Children respectfully observe equipped plants and share descriptive words about their experiences. The program concludes with a collaborative jam session and relaxation exercise."
