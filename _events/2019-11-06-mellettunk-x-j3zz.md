description: A collaborative artistic evening featuring writer Krisztián Grecsó and dancer Zoltán Grecsó. The performance explores shared identity and village roots through distinct artistic languages. Rather than text-explaining dance, it presents a peculiar struggle, spiritual inventory, virtual family constellation examining common themes from different perspectives. Features violin (J3ZZ / J3ZZ) and vocals (Réka Fodor).
