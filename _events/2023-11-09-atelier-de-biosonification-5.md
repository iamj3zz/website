description: "The collective Nout plant i chant demonstrates how plants can sing through sensors that capture their vibrations and convert them into melodies. This immersive experience reconnects participants with plant life while raising awareness about Réunion's flora diversity. Students from Cilaos, Le Baril, Grand Coude, and Montvert les Hauts participate in this unique initiative. Key workshop components: Atelier Zilien combines theatre, music, singing, and herbal knowledge in a warm atmosphere. Participants learn to sense aromatic plants and express their reactions through colors and emotions, developing group cohesion and emotional awareness. Atelier Robinson explores botanical and musical transcription through live illustrations, showing connections between leaf structures and musical composition. Participants create artwork using plant-based inks on paper, inspired by plant sounds. Atelier J3ZZ introduces instruments for listening to plants, including sensors, synthesizers, and the Vibrotanica box. Children observe and respectfully interact with equipped plants in small groups. Musical Jam - group session with live music performance, concluding with guided relaxation."
