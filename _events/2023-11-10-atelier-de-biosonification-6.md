description: "The collective Nout plant i chant demonstrates how to make plants sing by capturing their vibrations with sensors to create melodies. This immersive experience aims to reconnect participants with the plant world and raise awareness about Réunion's flora diversity. Students from Cilaos, Le Baril, Grand Coude, and Montvert les Hauts participate in workshops exploring the connection between the botanical world and musical expression. Workshop components include: Atelier Zilien - a multidisciplinary session combining theater, music, singing, and herbalism teaching participants to perceive aromatic plants through sensory descriptions and emotional responses; Atelier Robinson - focuses on graphic transcription relationships between botany and music using plant-based inks on paper, creating visual representations inspired by natural sounds; Atelier J3ZZ - introduces biosonification technology (patches, synthesizers, and instruments) that capture plant vibrations, allowing children to respectfully observe and listen to plants; Musical Jam - a 30-minute collective performance concluding with guided relaxation."
