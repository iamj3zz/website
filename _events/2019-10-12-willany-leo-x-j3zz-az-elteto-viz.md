description: "WILLANY LÉO — The Willany Leó Improvisational Dance Theatre, founded in 2008 by choreographer Zoltán Grecsó, creates work using dance, music, and improvisation. The company participated in the EU-funded Beyond Fronta: Bridging New Territories project (2012-2014), earning the Success Story designation. They received the László Lábán Special Award in May 2019. This performance was inspired by the Vaszary Gallery exhibition Rivers, Lakes, Seas – The Life-giving Water, featuring 19th-century European and Hungarian paintings. The exhibition explores water's significance to humanity through artworks drawn from international and Hungarian masterworks, addressing contemporary freshwater ecology issues while celebrating water's essential role in physical and spiritual nourishment. A gallery tour preceded the performance at 16:00, led by art historian Ágnes Szalay."
