description: The initiative combines electronic music, ecology, and music informatics to create an immersive and interactive connection with endemic plants of Réunion, transforming their vitality into enriching sonic and visual experiences. The experimental vibrotanica box device, developed since late 2019, converts plant biodata into sound through sensors and specialized software. The school-based component, Vibrotanica dann lékol, aims to educate students through biosonification workshops and musical creation activities, culminating in performances showcasing student compositions.
