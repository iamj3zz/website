description: "The Last Drops performed at the Völgykavalkád village festival in Taliándörögd. In 2009, the long-running Művészetek Völgye (Valley of Arts) festival in Kapolcs was cancelled for the second consecutive year due to financial difficulties (2008 had seen a reduced 'Bűvészetek Völgye' edition). In its place, the villages of the valley — Kapolcs, Taliándörögd, Vigántpetend and others — independently organised their own substitute festivals, collectively known as Völgykavalkád, running across late July and early August. Date is approximate — exact date to be confirmed."
