description: "Biosonification Workshop — The collective Nout plant i chant demonstrates how to make plants sing by using sensors to capture plant vibrations and convert them into melodies. This initiative aims to reconnect people with the plant world and raise awareness about the richness of Réunion's flora. The immersive experience involves students from Cilaos, Le Baril, Grand Coude, and Montvert les Hauts. Workshop components: Atelier Zilien combines theater, music, singing, and herbalism to help participants develop sensory awareness of aromatic plants and express responses through colors and emotions. Atelier Robinson teaches graphic transcription connecting botanical and musical forms, with participants creating ink drawings using vegetable-based materials on large sheets. Atelier J3ZZ focuses on discovering plant-listening instruments including patches, synthesizers, and the vibrotanica box. Atelier Musical concludes with a 30-minute jam session and relaxation exercise."
