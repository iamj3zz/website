description: "The artist was invited to the dance academy to explore sound and movement collaboration. The event began with the artist creating soundscapes for a dance class, followed by an open jam session where dancers and the sound artist inspired each other. The artist describes: I am grateful to have been invited to the dance academy to be myself, accept my mood, experiment soundscapes and push boundaries. A live recording archive of the session was made available on SoundCloud, described as rough as it is."
