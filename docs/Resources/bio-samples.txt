J3ZZ is a French artist & musician. He works in the transitional area between sound art, music, light, programming & science. His work unfolds through music releases, live performances & installations, especially. Through a phenomenological approach, his work is based both on experimenting and programming, always guided by concepts of time elasticity and as such located in the time-based media art field.

His interests in microsound have pushed him to expand his work by opening up new ways of including field recording-based sounds into his practice. Through a positive-nihilist approach to process and structural deconstruction, he explores the infinitesimal and the imperceptible over time, employing various scientific techniques and methods.

This meticulous attention to the barely audible often contrasts with his use of the acoustic violin, an instrument whose character he transforms through synthesizers, effects processing, and sensors. The tension between organic string timbre and electronic manipulation creates a dynamic interplay between the natural and the synthetic.

His practice also extends to working with living organisms to generate sounds and visuals in real time, further blurring the boundaries between art, science, and the biological world. These living systems become active collaborators in the creative process, introducing elements of unpredictability and organic evolution into his performances and installations.

New media serves as a vital medium of expression throughout his work, incorporating video, laser visuals, and other digital technologies into interactive, sensor-driven immersive environments. These spatial sound installations and performances invite audiences to become active participants, their movements and presence shaping the sonic and visual landscapes in real time. The integration of these technologies creates multisensory experiences where light, sound, and space converge into unified, responsive compositions.

The artist's work is characterized by a deep exploration of the infinitesimal—the extremely small—and the imperceptible—that which is not easily seen or noticed—suggesting a focus on experiences that are often overlooked. By employing scientific techniques, he invites the audience to reconsider how we perceive sound, time, and artistic creation. This intermingling of concepts from art and science creates a rich, multi-layered experience that challenges listeners to engage with the complexities of sound in new and thought-provoking ways.
